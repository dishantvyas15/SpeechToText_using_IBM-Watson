# SpeechToText_using_IBM-Watson

SpeechToText is a python program that enables you to create transcripts from an audio file.

You would require an IBM cloud account for getting access to the SpeechToText API from IBM Watson. Also, you may get an instance of the API for yourself, of which, the credentials would be used in the python script.

To run the script without any glitches, consider the requirements.txt file (at https://github.com/dishantvyas15/SpeechToText_using_IBM-Watson/blob/master/requirements.txt) and make sure you have all the required libraries installed on your (virtual) environment.

Supported language for speech: English

Used Packages: ibm_watson wget, pandas, numpy
